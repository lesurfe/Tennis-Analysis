# json_files

This folder stores JSON files used by the Tenis Analysis project.

Guidelines:
- Keep small, project-related JSON files here (config, sample data, fixtures).
- Do not commit large datasets. For large files, consider using git-lfs or external storage.
- Add a brief description in each JSON file header (as a top-level key) explaining its purpose.

If you want a different structure or example JSON files added, tell me which files to include.
